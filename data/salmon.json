    "funFact2": "They are sometimes called 'spring salmon' because they return to rivers earlier than other Pacific salmon species to spawn.",
    "funFact3": "Due to their size, Chinook are a primary prey species for Southern Resident killer whales, an endangered population.",
    "funFact4": "Chinook are the biggest Pacific salmon, sometimes reaching lengths of over 4 feet and weighing up to 129 pounds. "

    "funFact3": "Adult coho usually return to fresh water between late summer and early fall. Most choose streams close to the ocean, although some will journey as far as 1,500 kilometres (932 miles) inland. Young coho fry are different than the other salmon species as they stay in their spawning stream for a full year after they emerge from the gravel.",
    "funFact4": "Juvenile coho defend their territories through a series of maneuvers including a complex shimmy-shake, dubbed by scientists the 'wig-wag dance'. "
